FA-18 Abbreviated Autostart:
I disliked the text spam that comes with the autostart, so I removed the pop-up text outside of Start, Stop, and Complete.

Mission 01 - Hit the Tanker has two versions available.

01 Lite:  This version requires no mod.
01  VPC:  This version requires the user to install the VPC Airfield Equipment mod.

The only difference is the VPC version has more flightline decoration for the 7 minutes you're on the ground.  
Once you take off, there is no difference.

How do I install the VPC Airfield Equipment?

You may download it here: https://virpil.com/en/news/58-vpc-airfield-equipment-dlya-dcs-world

Extract it and place the "main" folder inside the "tech" folder in your Saved Games DCS folder.
The end result will look like this: X:\Users\YourPCname\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\tech\main

Does it work multiplayer?  Good question.  
I designed it to work with up to 4 human players, but I haven't had the privilege to test it.
